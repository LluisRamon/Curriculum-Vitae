# About

This repository has the latest version of my curriculum vitae.

# How it was made

I used TeX, a typesetting system designed and mostly written by Donald Knuth and released in 1978. TeX was designed with two main goals in mind: to allow anybody to produce high-quality books using a reasonably minimal amount of effort, and to provide a system that would give exactly the same results on all computers. 

You can [try it online][]. Or you can [download it here][].

moderncv doesn't provide a linkedIn logo. I added it inspired by this [StackExchange question][] and this [post][].

For my languages level, I used the [Interagency Language Roundtable scale][] that consists of descriptions of five levels of language proficiency.

If you want to make a similar cv you should install TeX, moderncv and use my TeX template and the linkedIn logo on Fotos.
