# How it was made

## TeX

I used TeX, a typesetting system designed and mostly written by Donald Knuth and released in 1978. _TeX_ was designed with two main goals in mind: to allow anybody to produce high-quality books using a reasonably minimal amount of effort, and to provide a system that would give exactly the same results on all computers. 

You can [try it online][] and you can [download it here][].

## A modern curriculum vitae class

There are [several packages][] that provide functionality for writing curriculum vitae. Some of them are [detailed here][].

I chose _moderncv_ because you can create a nice professional CV. You can [get it here][] and you can find [interesting questions here][].

To provide the LinkedIn logo, _moderncv_ version 1.5 is needed.

## External links

I added some links to my talks. Because some people didn't realize about them, I added an external link symbol. To add this symbol package _fontawesome_ is needed. You also have to use _XeTeX_ or _LuaTeX_ engine.

## Languages level

For my languages level, I used the [Interagency Language Roundtable scale][] that consists of descriptions of five levels of language proficiency. I followed this scale because I wanted that my CV looked like [my LinkedIn profile][].

# Do it yourself

If you want to make a similar CV you should install _TeX_, _moderncv 1.5_, _fontawesome_ and use my _TeX_ template and run it with _LuaTeX_ or _XeTeX_ engine.
